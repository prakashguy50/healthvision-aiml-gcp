# High-Level Design

## Architecture Overview
![System Architecture](docs/diagrams/architecture.png)

### Components:
1. **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
2. **Image Service**: Processes DICOM images, extracts features
3. **ML Orchestrator**: Manages model pipelines
4. **LLM Service**: Integrates with Vertex AI LLMs
5. **Pub/Sub**: GCP's event streaming
6. **BigQuery**: Analytics storage
7. **Cloud Storage**: DICOM image storage
8. **Vertex AI**: Model training and serving

## Data Flow
1. DICOM image uploaded → Cloud Storage
2. Event triggered → Image Service processes
3. Features sent → ML Model (Vertex AI)
4. Results + LLM analysis → Database
5. Notifications sent if critical
